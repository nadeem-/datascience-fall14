PRATTVILLE, Ala â€“  Prattville police say a suspected meth manufacturer has been arrested with help from his pet dog.

Department spokeswoman Paula Barlow says Edwin Henderson ran from police who were serving a drug search warrant on Wednesday. Barlow says Henderson jumped into a ravine behind his house and was followed by his dog, Bo.

Barlow says an investigator pointed at Henderson and told the dog "go get him."

Barlow says the dog chased Henderson and was followed by two Prattville Drug Enforcement Unit investigators.

Barlow says Bo found Henderson lying in tall grass. Henderson was arrested when authorities saw the dog had stopped to wag his tail.

Henderson is charged with failure to obey police, manufacturing a controlled substance and possession of drug paraphernalia. It's unclear if he has an attorney.
