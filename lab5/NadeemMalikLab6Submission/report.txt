====FOR PART 1===
How to run:
Run "python product_dedup.py"
Classify around 15-20 items manually (recommended 10 postiive, 10 negative)
Run "python product_eval.py"

Report:
We used the fields title, manufacturer, and price. Using a custom comparator for the price field to handle the case when "gbp" or extra whitespacing was present. In the case of 1 field having "gbp", we used the current GBP-USD exchange rate to covert to USD and compare the values.

For our evaluation script, we used a series of hash maps to find duplicates.

We set recall_weight to 1 to gain a large number of duplicates, even though most were false positives, we found better results than with a recall_weight of 0.
